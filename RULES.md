## HacktoberFest Rules :

- To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must **register** and make **four valid pull requests** (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).
- Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the `hacktoberfest` topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
- Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- This year, the first **55,000** participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.
